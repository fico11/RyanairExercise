#### Jmeter
###### I built a Jmeter script using the endpoints given in which I used a regular expression extractor to pull the idUser to use in the following requests as well as variables to get yesterday's and today's date.

#### Jenkins
###### I installed Jenkins in order to be able to build a parameterized job to gain flexibility in terms of how much load to apply on the app.

#### Grafana and InfluxDB
###### I created an Influx database and associated Grafana to listen the requests Jmeter would send to it in order to have a real time feeling on how the test was performing.
